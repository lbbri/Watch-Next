## Overview
### Description

With a Watch Next or Facebook account, a user can login to the app and begin their movie and TV show discovery journey. Watch Next is a mobile app that allows users to keep track of movies and TV shows that they have watched and would like to watch in the future. Watch Next then takes these user interactions and creates a user-specific suggestions list with titles that should appeal to the user.
